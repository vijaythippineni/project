    <h3>suresh.</h3>
<p>
    I accidentally booked a vehicle for incorrect dates. Even though this was of course my own fault, the customer service was really kind and helpful. They efficiently helped me and found a solution on such short a notice. Thank you! ðŸ’ª

    Also, I quickly scrolled through some of bad reviews this service had recently and see that much of those are because of bad customer service at various rental car companies. This is, I think, sadly a pattern with many of these companies, but also not something rentalcars.com is responsible for in my opinion.
